# Distinction Physics

A meta-theoretical framework deriving the structure of accessible reality from two axioms about distinction-making under energy constraints.

## The Framework

**Axiom 1**: All distinctions cost energy
**Axiom 2**: All observers have finite energy budgets

From these alone, we derive:
- Quantization and uncertainty (quantum mechanics)
- Entropy and the Second Law (thermodynamics)
- Consciousness as self-referential distinction
- Spacetime as boundary network structure

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

This site deploys to Vercel. Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as an environment variable.

## Structure

- `/src/content/essay-1/` - Essay sections and configuration
- `/src/content/propositions.ts` - Concept network nodes
- `/src/lib/guide-prompt.ts` - Leibniz (guide) system prompt
- `/src/pages/` - Astro pages (essay, explore, API)
- `/src/components/` - UI components

## Status
