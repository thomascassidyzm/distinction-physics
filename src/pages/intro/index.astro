        <p>You know how every explanation seems to assume something else?</p>

        <p>You explain X in terms of Y, then Y in terms of Z, and eventually someone asks "but what about Z?" It's explanations all the way down.</p>

        <p>The question is whether there's a bottom to this. Not just philosophically—practically. Is there something so fundamental that everything else can be understood in terms of it?</p>

        <p>I think there is. And I think it's been staring us in the face the whole time.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>The Starting Point</h2>

        <p>Everything we can think about, perceive, or interact with has one thing in common: <em>it's distinguishable from something else</em>.</p>

        <p>The screen you're reading is distinct from the wall behind it. These words are distinct from each other. You are distinct from not-you. This moment is distinct from the last one.</p>

        <p>This might seem trivially obvious. It's supposed to be. That's actually the point.</p>

        <p>The question is: could anything exist <em>for you</em> without being distinguishable? Could you perceive something that wasn't different from anything else? Think about something with no distinguishing features whatsoever?</p>

        <p>I don't think you could. And I don't think it's just a limitation of human minds. I think it's deeper than that.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>The Inescapable</h2>

        <p>Here's the key move: even trying to <em>argue against</em> this uses distinction.</p>

        <p>The words you'd use to deny it are distinct from other words. The concepts you'd employ are distinct from other concepts. The very act of disagreement distinguishes your position from mine.</p>

        <p>You can't escape distinction by thinking your way out of it. It's more fundamental than thought. More fundamental than language. More fundamental than any conceptual scheme you could construct.</p>

        <p>Philosophers call this a "transcendental" argument. You identify what <em>must</em> be true for any thought or experience to be possible at all. And distinction-making is that thing. It's what makes anything else possible.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Where It Gets Interesting</h2>

        <p>Now, this would just be a philosophical curiosity if it didn't have consequences. An interesting observation to file away and forget.</p>

        <p>But it turns out that when you combine "distinction is primitive" with two simple observations about physics, something remarkable happens.</p>

        <p><strong>Observation 1:</strong> All distinctions cost energy.</p>

        <p>Think about it: to know that something is in state A rather than state B, those states have to be <em>physically</em> distinguishable. And physical distinguishability isn't free. Every sensor, every measurement, every perception requires energy. Even a thermometer needs thermal energy flowing through it to register a temperature.</p>

        <p><strong>Observation 2:</strong> We all have finite energy budgets.</p>

        <p>Whether you're a thermometer running on thermal gradients or a human brain burning 20 watts, nobody gets infinite energy to spend on making distinctions. There are limits.</p>

        <p>That's it. Those are the only physical claims we need.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>What Falls Out</h2>

        <p>From just those constraints—distinctions cost energy, observers have limited energy—the structure of what we can observe starts to fall out with something approaching mathematical necessity.</p>

        <p>The uncertainty principle? It's about how you allocate your finite energy budget between distinguishing position and distinguishing momentum. You can't have perfect precision on both because you don't have infinite energy.</p>

        <p>Entropy and the second law of thermodynamics? Distinctions decay when you stop putting energy into maintaining them. That <em>is</em> entropy increase.</p>

        <p>Why mathematics is so unreasonably effective in physics? Because mathematics is fundamentally about patterns of distinction. Numbers are distinctions. Operations are distinction-transformations. We're using the language of distinction to describe a reality structured by distinction.</p>

        <p>Consciousness? Self-referential distinction-making. A system that can make distinctions about its own distinction-making processes. That's what we are.</p>

        <p>Learning? Optimising the energy efficiency of distinction-making. Getting better at the same distinctions using less energy.</p>

        <p>I'm not claiming this explains everything. But it's remarkable how much falls into place when you take distinction seriously as the primitive.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>What This Is (And Isn't)</h2>

        <p>The framework doesn't compete with physics. Quantum mechanics and general relativity work beautifully. The question is: <em>why</em> do they work? What is it about reality—or about observers like us—that makes these particular mathematical structures the right ones?</p>

        <p>The answer, I think, is that physics describes what finite-energy observers necessarily encounter when they make distinctions about their world. Quantisation, uncertainty, entropy increase—these aren't arbitrary features of nature. They're what <em>any</em> observer with limited resources would have to find.</p>

        <p>It's a framework for understanding why physics looks the way it does.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Where To Go From Here</h2>

        <p>I've structured this project in layers, depending on how deep you want to go:</p>

        <div class="path-options">
          <a href="/essay" class="path-card">
            <div class="path-content">
              <h3>The Essay</h3>
              <p>A complete walkthrough of the framework in one sitting. More rigorous than this introduction, but still readable.</p>
            </div>
          </a>

          <a href="/explore" class="path-card">
            <div class="path-content">
              <h3>Explore</h3>
              <p>An interactive concept map. Navigate the ideas as a network, building understanding node by node.</p>
            </div>
          </a>

          <a href="/treatise" class="path-card">
            <div class="path-content">
              <h3>The Treatise</h3>
              <p>The full formal treatment. Ten modules of rigorous argument, definitions, and derivations.</p>
            </div>
          </a>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="intro-section closing">
        <p>This framework has survived 36 adversarial attacks across 7 rounds of critical examination. Every critique either failed to land or generated refinements that made the framework stronger.</p>

        <p>But ultimately, it stands or falls on whether it helps you understand something you didn't understand before. Whether it makes things clearer. Whether the pieces fit together in a way that feels right.</p>

        <p>That's for you to decide.</p>
