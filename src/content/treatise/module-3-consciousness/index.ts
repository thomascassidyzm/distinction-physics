    '[INTERPRETED] Consciousness is self-referential distinction-making at sufficient complexity—this is interpretive vocabulary, not a scientific explanation',

    '[INTERPRETED] Qualia are the interior perspective on boundary maintenance—a philosophical reframing, not a solution to the hard problem',
    'The framework RELOCATES the hard problem (from "how does matter generate experience?" to "why does self-referential boundary maintenance have an inside?")—it does NOT solve or dissolve it',
    '[IMPORTED] Conscious processing costs ~20W total (~8W for conscious processing) in humans—this is an observation from neuroscience, not a derivation',
    '[INTERPRETED] Attention as the allocation of finite distinction-maintenance resources',
    '[INTERPRETED] Agency emerges from self-referential evaluation of possible boundaries',
    'This module offers philosophical vocabulary for understanding consciousness—it complements neuroscience, not replaces it',
