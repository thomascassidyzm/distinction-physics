This self-referential loop, maintained by continuous energy expenditure, is proposed as what constitutes conscious experience. **Epistemic note**: This is an interpretive conjecture, not a derivation from axioms. The identification of consciousness with distinction-making is a philosophical claim that the framework offers, not proves.',
