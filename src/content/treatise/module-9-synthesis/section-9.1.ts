Beginning with two simple axioms—that all distinctions cost energy, and that observers-like-us have finite energy budgets—we have INTERPRETED the essential structures of mathematics, consciousness, learning, quantum mechanics, spacetime, and thermodynamics through distinction vocabulary. However, epistemic honesty requires acknowledging that we import substantial physics from established theory rather than deriving it from axioms alone.',

        '**Module 4** derived spacetime from the structure of distinction cascades. Space is the set of distinctions an observer can potentially make; distance measures the energy required to propagate distinctions between locations. Time is the ordering of distinction-making events within an observer\'s experience. The speed of light is the maximum rate at which distinctions can propagate. General relativity emerges from the interaction between energy density and distinction-making capacity.',

        '**Module 5** interpreted thermodynamics through distinction vocabulary. Entropy is reframed as distinction-decay. However, the Second Law "derivation" imports statistical mechanics (equiprobability, typicality arguments). Landauer\'s principle grounds Axiom 1 rather than following from it.',
