Beginning with the transcendental observation that distinction-making is necessarily prior to all theorizing, and grounding this in two physical axioms—that distinctions cost energy [IMPORTS Landauer], and that observers-like-us have finite energy budgets—we have developed a unifying vocabulary for understanding physics, mathematics, and cognition. However, epistemic honesty requires clearly distinguishing what the framework derives, interprets, and imports.',
