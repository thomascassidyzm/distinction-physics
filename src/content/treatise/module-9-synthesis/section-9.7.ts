        'We began with two axioms: All distinctions cost energy (grounded in Landauer). All observers-like-us have finite energy budgets. Through these axioms, we INTERPRETED the structures of mathematics, consciousness, learning, quantum mechanics, spacetime, and thermodynamics---while importing substantial physics from established theory.',

      type: 'paragraph',
      content:
        'The interpretation revealed conceptual unity: these structures can be understood through common vocabulary---distinction-making under constraint. Physics, mathematics, and consciousness share this interpretive lens. However, the unity is conceptual, not derivational: we provide vocabulary while importing substantial physics.',

      content:
        'This interpretation REFRAMES old problems and generates new questions. The hard problem is reframed (consciousness as distinction-making), but WHY it feels like something remains unexplained. The measurement problem is reframed (measurement as distinction creation), but we provide vocabulary, not mechanism. The framework provides perspective, not proof.',

      type: 'paragraph',
      content:
        'New questions emerge: What is the minimum energy for specific distinctions? What is the quantum gravity of distinction space? How do multiple observers\' distinctions interrelate? These questions are open, but they are tractable---they point toward experimental and theoretical programs.',

      type: 'paragraph',
      content:
        'The framework is bold but not grandiose. It offers a perspective, not a final theory. It invites investigation, not belief. It may be wrong in detail while right in direction. Only careful work---theoretical, experimental, philosophical---will determine its ultimate value.',

    {
      type: 'paragraph',
      content:
        'But if the framework is even approximately correct, it offers something rare: a unified foundation for understanding reality from the inside, as observers who make distinctions under constraint. It offers not a view from nowhere but a view from somewhere---from the situated perspective of finite beings in a cosmos they are just beginning to understand.',
