        'We began with two axioms: All distinctions cost energy. All observers-like-us have finite energy budgets. From these axioms, we derived the essential structures of mathematics, consciousness, learning, quantum mechanics, spacetime, and thermodynamics.',

    {
      type: 'paragraph',
      content:
        'The derivation revealed something unexpected: these structures are not separate but unified. They are facets of one reality---the reality of distinction-making under constraint. Physics, mathematics, and consciousness are not three things but one thing seen from different angles.',

      content:
        'This unity dissolves old problems and generates new questions. The hard problem of consciousness dissolves because consciousness IS distinction-making. The measurement problem dissolves because measurement IS distinction creation. The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics dissolves because mathematics and physics share a common subject.',

      content:
        'New questions emerge: What is the minimum energy for specific distinctions? What is the quantum gravity of distinction space? How do multiple observers\' distinctions interrelate? These questions are open, but they are tractable---they point toward experimental and theoretical programs.',

      content:
        'The framework is bold but not grandiose. It offers a perspective, not a final theory. It invites investigation, not belief. It may be wrong in detail while right in direction. Only careful work---theoretical, experimental, philosophical---will determine its ultimate value.',

      type: 'paragraph',
      content:
        'But if the framework is even approximately correct, it offers something rare: a unified foundation for understanding reality from the inside, as observers who make distinctions under constraint. It offers not a view from nowhere but a view from somewhere---from the situated perspective of finite beings in a cosmos they are just beginning to understand.',
