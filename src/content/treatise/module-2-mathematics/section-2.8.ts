      type: 'paragraph',
      content:
        'Why are complex numbers so effective in physics? Because many physical systems involve oscillations, waves, and rotations. These phenomena have natural two-dimensional structure (amplitude and phase), and complex numbers provide the most energy-efficient way to maintain distinctions about such systems.',

        'The "mystery" of why $\\sqrt{-1}$ is useful dissolves: complex numbers are not mysterious abstract entities but efficient representations of rotational distinction patterns. OLUs that need to track phase relationships converge on complex arithmetic because it is the most stable pattern for this purpose.',

The group structure is not imposed from outside but emerges from the boundary patterns of the square itself.',
