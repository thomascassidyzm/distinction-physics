  keyInsights: [
    'Distinction-making is transcendentally prior to all premises—you cannot state any theory without first making distinctions',
    'This framework is complementary to existing physics, not a replacement for it',
    'Two axioms ground the framework: distinctions cost energy (imports Landauer), and OLUs have finite energy budgets',
    'The framework interprets and provides vocabulary for physics, mathematics, and cognition—it does not derive them from nothing',
    'The key contribution domain is learning: understanding learning as anti-entropic distinction pattern building',
  ],
  connectionsToNext: [
    'Module 1 formalizes the distinction operator and provides mathematical rigor',
    'The energy cost of distinction enables interpretation of physical constraints',
    'The OLU formalism connects to existing physics through Landauer\'s principle',
