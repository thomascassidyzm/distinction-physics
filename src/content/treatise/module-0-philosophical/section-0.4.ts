        'Traditional philosophy has struggled with the relationship between observers and the observed world. How can subjects access objects? How can minds know an external reality? The very framing of these questions presupposes a fundamental separation—a gulf between knower and known that must somehow be bridged. Our framework dissolves this apparent problem by showing it rests on a false premise.',

        'In our view, both observers and observed are constituted by the same fundamental process: distinction-making under energy constraints. An observer is an OLU—a system that responds differentially to inputs, making distinctions about its environment. The observed entity is also a system of maintained boundaries, a pattern of distinctions distinguishable from other patterns. Both are boundary-systems; both require energy to maintain their existence-as-distinct.',
